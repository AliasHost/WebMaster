WebMaster
============
Introduction
--------------
WebMaster is an open-source all-purpose website content managment system (CMS) that is currently in development by [Alias Host](http://www.aliashost.com) in partnership with [MyRuneLog's Development Team](http://www.myrunelog.com/forum/).

Brief History
---------------
Originally dreamed up by David Schiehsl as a CMS to bring together several independent
CMS's and allow them to interface together including [Invision Power Board](http://www.invisionpower.com/)
and a On-line Radio Control Panel such as [Centova Cast](http://www.centova.com/pages/cast).

It soon developed into something far larger than originally thought of as David and a friend, now Lead
Developer Devon McAvoy, realized that it not only had potential to link and utilize information from
various CMS's it could also be used as CMS in and of itself allow the alteration of website templates
and other basic website management functions.

This potential was also recognized [MyRuneLog.com](http://www.myrunelog.com/) owner Harley Dishon, 
friend of David's, who was looking for a CMS for his website. Harley took it upon himself to assemble the
current MyRuneLog Development Team, headed by Devon McAvoy, to undertake the daunting task of writing 
WebMaster.

Running
---------
Running WebMaster currently requires

The following Play Modules, which can be installed using `play install` followed by the module name and version number

  * [Scala 0.9.1](http://www.playframework.org/modules/scala)
