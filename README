NOTES:
 - Please use CamelCase when possible.
 - Also because PHP has no visible data types, with the exception of an array, please use Hungarian notation for both functions, vars, and constants.
   - When a function is of void datatype, returns nothing or has no return, please omit the Hungarian notation prefix.
   - When not using a primitive dataype such as a custom class please use the Hungarian notation of 'o' to denote its an object datatype.
   
Thanks,
